# conftest.py

"""Project-wide pytest configuration.

Disables agentic_trading's logging for the whole test session — at import
time, before any test module's own imports can trigger
`agentic_trading.logging_config.get_logger()`'s self-configuration.
`configure_logging()` only does real work on its *first* call per process
(see its docstring); since pytest imports this file before collecting any
test module, this call wins that race deterministically. Without it,
running the suite would append hundreds of test-run lines to the real
`log/agentic_trading.log` on every single `pytest` invocation — a file
meant to be an actual user's run history, not test noise.

`tests/unit/test_logging_config.py` tests the logging module itself; it
resets the module's internal state per-test (see that file) to configure
fresh instances despite this session-wide disabling.
